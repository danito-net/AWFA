# AWFA - Attaché for Work From Anywhere

The **AWFA** prototype device is using [Google Coral Dev Board](https://coral.ai/docs/dev-board/get-started) as a main processing / computing unit. Please follow these steps to prepare the working **AWFA** prototype device (these steps are for macOS operating system):

#### 1.1. Flash the Google Coral Dev Board ####

* Download and unzip the SD card image: [enterprise-eagle-flashcard-20211117215217.zip](https://mendel-linux.org/images/enterprise/eagle/enterprise-eagle-flashcard-20211117215217.zip); The ZIP contains one file named `flashcard_arm64.img`
* Use a program such as [balenaEtcher](https://www.balena.io/etcher/) to flash the `flashcard_arm64.img` file to your microSD card; but I prefer use [Raspberry Pi Imager](https://downloads.raspberrypi.org/imager/) for smaller download size. This takes 5-10 minutes, depending on the speed of your microSD card and adapter (I suggest to use a Class-10 U3 microSD or faster).

* While the card is being flashed, make sure the Google Coral Dev Board is completely unplugged, and change the boot mode switches to boot from SD card, as shown here:

* Once the card is flashed, safely remove it from your computer and insert it into the Dev Board (the card's pins face toward the board). The board should **NOT** be powered on yet.
* Power up the board by connecting your 2-3 A power cable to the USB-C port labeled "PWR". The board's red LED should turn on. **Caution:** Do not attempt to power the board by connecting it to your computer.
* When the board boots up, it loads the SD card image and begins flashing the board's eMMC memory.  It should finish in 5-10 minutes, depending on the speed of your microSD card.  You'll know it's done when the board shuts down and the red LED turns off.
* When the red LED turns off, unplug the power and remove the microSD card.
* Change the boot mode switches to eMMC mode, as shown here:

#### 1.19. Setting Virtual Environment, Install PIP and Install DataStax Python Driver ####

    sudo apt install python3-venv
    python3 -m venv awfa-env
    source awfa-env/bin/activate
    wget https://bootstrap.pypa.io/get-pip.py
    sudo python3 get-pip.py
    pip install cassandra-driver
    python -c 'import cassandra; print (cassandra.__version__)'
    


#### 1.20. Make an Automatic Script Running on Boot ####

* Placed the main script for AWFA device on Google Coral default user home directory (`/home/mendel/awfa.sh`).
* Make that script executable: `chmod +x /home/mendel/awfa.sh`
* Add that script to the cron table on Mendel Linux: `crontab -e`
* Add this line into the cron table on Mendel Linux, and then save it:


    @reboot bash /home/mendel/awfa.sh
